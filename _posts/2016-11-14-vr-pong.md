title: VR Pong
---

I published a new project today named [VR Pong](http://vr-pong.com). It's a collaboration where Una Kravets and I learn about WebVR and hopefully make something cool.

The idea is that each week one of us adds something to a VR scene then passes it back for the other person to build upon. We'll also write a short blog post about what we learnt both creative and technical.

So far we added one 'Pong' each. I created the initial scene with a distinctive sky and reflective water for the ground surface. Una added to this with a strange alien object with beautiful light that she built from scratch in Blender! I'm really looking forward to seeing what's next.  

I'd love to hear from you if you have any ideas and in future we may open it up to contributions.

If you want to follow our progress we will be updating the blog and posting each VR scene at [http://vr-pong.com](http://vr-pong.com).
