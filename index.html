<h1 class="page-title">Hello, I'm Mike Riethmuller</h1>
<p>I'm a <strong>web developer</strong> and I make all sorts of stuff for the web. You can find some of my <strike>code</strike> <strike>work</strike> <strike>experiments</strike> <strike>creations</strike> shame on <a href="http://codepen.io/MadeByMike/">CodePen</a> or <a href="https://github.com/MadeByMike">GitHub</a> and you can talk to me on <a href="https://twitter.com/MikeRiethmuller">Twitter</a>.</p>
<p>When I'm not making things for the web I sometimes think about stuff and on rare occasions I write about it. You can find some of my writing here. </p>

	<h2>More about me</h2>
	<p>Oh, hey! You're still here, good for you! You should know I'm passionate about web development and that doesn't just mean standards; I'm an advocate for anything and anyone that contributes to good quality web development.</p>
	<p>I've worked as a front-end developer on some of Australia's largest websites as well as some of the smallest community sites. When I'm not building sites or blogging I like to experiment with code. I love learning new things and finding techniques that challenge what we think is best practice. Although very few ideas make it into my production toolkit, I find experimentation is the best way learn and the only way to discover new techniques.</p>
	<p>Although I'm not the best writer or speaker I try to share everything I learn, I blog here, help organise community meetups and sometimes events.</p>
	<p>I'm not actively looking for work at the moment but if you really want to ask me something you will find my email below.</p>
