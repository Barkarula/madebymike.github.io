Throughout 2017 I bookmarked numerous articles and I've tried to shortlist those that were most interesting, influential, topical or stood out for other reasons.

## [An Abridged Cartoon Introduction To WebAssembly](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2017/05/abridged-cartoon-introduction-webassembly/)

Lin's drawings are fantastic! Her talk A "Cartoon Intro to Performance in React" was also a standout of 2017. This article was a great intro to WebAssembly with a unique and memorable approach.

Bruce is always an excellent writer and well informed on this topic. The research and statistics in this article provide indisputable perspective on the size, scope and growth of the web and the challenges we face. This had me pondering for weeks.  

## [AMPersand](https://ethanmarcotte.com/wrote/ampersand/)

AMP was an thing in 2017 and I'm still AMPed up about this issue. Once again Ethan explains how I feel in a far more eloquent and balanced way than I am capable of.

## [Migrating from Jekyll+Github Pages to Hugo+Netlify](https://www.sarasoueidan.com/blog/jekyll-ghpages-to-hugo-netlify/)

I built lots of apps and sites sites with Netlify in 2017 including 4 hugo builds. It's still a combination I love and this article by Sara is so comprehensive, I decided not to write my own.

## [Designing Tables to be Read, Not Looked At](http://alistapart.com/article/web-typography-tables)

We haven't been doing a very good job of styling tables. Richard has some great examples in this article and I've seen the mistakes he points out repeated over and over. I was also lucky enough to see Richard Rutter speak on this topic at Web Direction this year and it was one of my favourite talks too.

## [Yes, That Web Project Should Be a PWA](http://alistapart.com/article/yes-that-web-project-should-be-a-pwa)

The popularity of PWAs grew in 2017. Aaron Gustafson provided a great high-level overview of what it's all about.

## [React Performance Fixes on Airbnb Listing Pages](https://medium.com/airbnb-engineering/recent-web-performance-fixes-on-airbnb-listing-pages-6cd8d93df6f4)

As the popularity of React continues to grow, so does the importance of frontend performance and this article covers both these topics. This a really comprehensive guide to finding and fixing performance issues in React.


## [The Critical Request](https://medium.com/@benschwarz/the-critical-request-90bb47da5769)

On the topic of performance fellow Aussie Ben Schwarz a stack of great article on this in 2017. Choosing just one was hard.

## [Most hearted pens of 2017](https://codepen.io/2017/popular/pens/)

## [A Unified Styling Language](https://medium.com/seek-blog/a-unified-styling-language-d0c208de2660)

I feel like the discussion around CSS-in-JS has matured. This was a well needed articular take on the issues. 


## [Building a Visual Language](https://airbnb.design/building-a-visual-language/)

The Airbnb design system was influential this year, as was their [JavaScript style guide](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript). This article shows why.
